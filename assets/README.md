# Cross Document Candidate Resolution Tool

Welcome to the Cross Document Candidate Resolution tool. The purpose of this tool is to provide an easy way to annotate pairs of frame candidates across documents.

You will be shown a news article summary and an abstract from a linked scientific paper. One candidate mention will be highlighted in each document.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it is to determine whether the candidate mentions relate to the same candidate or not.
